# Overview

This program was created to learn the basics of the C++ programming language.  This is a maze traversal program that demonstrates understanding of recursion, loops, expressions, reading/writing to files, classes, functions, variables, conditionals, and arrays. 

This maze traversal program reads a maze from a txt file and loads it into the Maze class in the form of a two dimensional array.  The maze is solved using recursion. Once the maze is solved, the solved maze is written to another txt file.
